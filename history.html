            <h1>History of Last Bacates</h1>
            <p>In late 2023, the Middleridge Cakes was a group known for their relentless ding-dong ditching and creative base-building in Middleridge Park. Their activities ranged from simple pranks to creating elaborate hiding spots.</p>
            <p>After the disbandment of Middleridge Cakes, the All Day Bacates emerged with ten members. They escalated their activities, building a sophisticated tunnel system extending up to 80 feet. Unfortunately, the tunnels were destroyed during a severe flood, leading to a series of dramatic events.</p>
            <p>One significant incident occurred during a confrontation with the Third Rivalry faction. The All Day Bacates found themselves trapped in a tunnel with stale air and little oxygen. To escape, they played a fake police siren sound effect on their phone, scaring off the Third Rivalry members and managing to escape just in time before their situation became critical.</p>
            <p>Another notable incident involved being surrounded by rival factions during a flood. The All Day Bacates members had to hide while the creek was flooded, and some were trapped due to quicksand and enemy factions. This situation, while dangerous, was more of a play fight, highlighting the group’s resilience and resourcefulness.</p>
